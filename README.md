# TinyCircuits-Whisker-Hall-Effect
# AST1006 Rev2

The design files are located under design_files/ for the TinyCircuits AST1006 Rev 2 PCB. This is a whisker board which is either populated for digital or analog magnetic readings.

The digital variant features a humble TCS40DLR hall effect switch with High/Low output and a switching point near 3.5mT (35 Gauss) and 1.4mT (14 Gauss) of Hysteresis built in.

The analog version features the Allegro A1454 linear hall effect sensor with 12-bit output and built in temperature compensation. This sensor works best with Ferrite type magnets.

Format is in Cadsoft Eagle format - Eagle version 6.2 was used for the original design.

This project uses designs and concepts developed as part of the Arduino project and the LilyPad project.  The TinyCircuits design files themselves (schematics, PCB and libraries) are not directly derived from these works' design files and have been created new, however the concepts and basic architecture behind the TinyDuino and TinyLily products are derived and we thank the hard work of the organizations below for their contributions to open-source hardware:
